# GenAI Repository

Welcome to my GenAI repository! This space is dedicated to collecting and showcasing my explorations, projects, and learning resources in the field of Generative AI. Here you'll find everything from personal projects and code implementations to summaries of relevant research papers.

## Current Focus: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Currently, the primary focus is on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is a powerful technique that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by allowing them to access and incorporate external knowledge sources during the generation process.

### Contents:

* **RAG/**: This directory contains resources related to RAG implementations.
    * `Basic_RAG_WorkFlow.jpg`: A visual representation of the RAG workflow.
    * `RAG_from_Scratch.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a practical implementation of RAG.

### Future Additions:

This repository is a work in progress, and I plan to add the following in the future:

* Implementations of other GenAI techniques (e.g., fine-tuning, prompt engineering).
* Summaries and analysis of key research papers in the field.
* Personal GenAI projects and experiments.
* Code examples for various LLM APIs and tools.
* Documentation and tutorials.

### Contributions:

While this is primarily a personal repository, I welcome feedback and suggestions. If you find any errors or have ideas for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Stay Tuned:

I'll be regularly updating this repository with new content, so be sure to check back often!
